This thesis represents the research work to detect low-amplitude
stationary and non-stationary signals and its application to the
diagnosis of weak faults in Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM).
SCIM incipient faults include Broken Rotor Bar (BRB), eccentricity
faults, bearing defects, and inter-turn short circuit fault. If
the incipient faults are not detected at an early state, and
proper maintenance is not carried out, then it may result in
complete failure of the motor and loss of production.

In this research, SCIM faults are detected by identifying fault
specific frequency components in the motor armature current and
motor vibration signal spectrum. First, a Multiple Signal
Classifier (MUSIC) based method has been developed to detect the
SCIM faults under low loads using a single phase current signal at
steady state. The size of the autocorrelation matrix for MUSIC has
been estimated from the derived analytic relations between the
matrix size and the required frequency resolution. Under some
applications, the loading of the motor changes with time and
during that transient period, the steady-state fault diagnosis
methods may fail. Therefore, another method is developed to detect
SCIM faults during the time-varying and fixed loading conditions.
However, the loading of the motor needs to be higher compared to
the steady-state based method to detect the faults. In some
applications, the primary requirement is to develop a low-cost
online system for continuous condition monitoring. Therefore, a
fault detection algorithm with low computational complexity has
been developed which uses only a single current sensor. The low
complexity method can detect faults during the steady state of the
motor operations but needs higher loading compared to the first
proposed method. Sometimes it may be required to quickly assess
the motor health without any dedicated sensor or processing unit.
For such requirements, an Android application has been developed
which will convert any Android mobile phone with inbuilt
accelerometer into a SCIM fault diagnosis tool. The proposed four
algorithms have been tested using data from a laboratory setup of
22kW SCIM loaded by a 24kW DC generator.
