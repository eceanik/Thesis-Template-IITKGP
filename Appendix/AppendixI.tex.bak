\chapter{Appendix A}{Algorithms}
\label{app:roc_ss} To test the performance of the proposed method
in Chapter~\ref{chap:ss_fault_detection}, current data has been
simulated from the healthy and faulty model (BRB) developed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:fault_model} at a fixed loading (56\%). Then,
different level of noise has been added to the simulated current
data. For each noise level, 100 test runs were performed for
healthy and faulty cases each by randomly generating the noise
values. The maximum ECDF magnitudes estimated from the proposed
methodology has been used to generate the ROC curve in MATLAB
(perfcurve function) Fig.~\ref{fig:roc_ss}. With the increase of
SNR value, the detectability improves as the Area Under the Curve
(AUC) increases.

\end{figure}
SNR has been evaluated as
\begin{align}
SNR = 10{\log _{10}}\left( {\frac{{{P_f}}}{{{P_n}}}} \right).
\label{eqn:snr_ss}
\end{align}
where $P_f$ and $P_n$ are the power of the left BRB fault
frequency and the noise power respectively.
